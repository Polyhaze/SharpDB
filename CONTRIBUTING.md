# Introduction
First of all, thank you for wanting to contribute to SharpDB! As an open-source project, we encourage the community to pitch in and help wherever they can; bug reports, pull requests and more! However, we're just going to leave a few guidelines here to make sure everything goes smoothly.

# Bug Reports & issues
Encountered a bug? Well don't sit there and deal with it, report it! We have an issue template that should automatically place itself in the issue description box when you create an issue. Fill that out and hit "Submit Issue". We'll then evaluate the bug and _try_ and replicate it on our machines.

BUT WAIT! Sometimes, it's not a bug, but maybe a feature request... In which case remove the issue template and describe whatever the issue's about.

# Pull requests
Making pull requests is even easier!
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Make changes to your fork
4. Create a pull request!
5. We'll then evaluate your changes, and either merge it or request changes to be made.
